## **Validation**

### HTML Validation

To validate my HTML code, I used the [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org).

I had a error in my base.html so all my pages had the same bug:

![HTML validation error for landing page](/docs/testing/validationerror_html.png)

Once I had resolved the issues on the list, validation passed on every page. I will address the error fixes in the [bugs](#bugs) section below.
I was given the all clear for every page with 'No errors or warnings to show', as seen here.

After i adjusted html none of the pages had any bugs as shown below:

### CSS Validation

I used the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate my custom CSS file. I did not test bootstrap CSS.
The result came back with no errors found as can be seen here.
